I am a researcher in applied mathematics at the MAP5 laboratory at Paris-Cité university. 
My main research interest is combining mathematical methodology and novel deep learning approaches to solve challenging problems.
I have defended my PhD thesis "Image restoration with deep generative models" at the Bordeaux Institute of Mathematics (IMB), under the supervision of Nicolas Papadakis and Andrés Almansa.
