I am a PhD student at the Bordeaux university, working under the supervision of Nicolas Papadakis and Andr√©s Almansa. My main research interests include deep generative models and image inverse problems.
In particular, I am working on developping optimization algorithms designed to incorporate deep generative models as a prior in variational problems.
