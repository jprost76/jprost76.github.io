I am a PhD student at the Bordeaux university, working under the supervision of Nicolas Papadakis and Andr√©s Almansa. My main research interests include deep generative models and image inverse problems.
In particular, I am working on developping optimization algorithms designed to incorporate deep generative models as a prior in variational problems.

I am currently visiting the [Cambridge image analysis](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/cia/cambridge-image-analysis) group, where I am working on video shadow detection and medical image registration.
