I am researcher in applied mathematics. My research interests include inverse problems, deep generative models and computer vision.
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the research center on computer science, signal processing and automatics of Lille (CRIStAL). 
Before that, I have defended my PhD thesis on image restoration with deep generative models, in Bordeaux university, under the supervision of Nicolas Papadakis and Andr√©s Almansa.
