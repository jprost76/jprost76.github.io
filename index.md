I am a postdoctoral researcher in applied mathematics at the research center on computer science, signal processing and automatics of Lille (CRIStAL).
My research interests include deep learning, generative models, computer vision and inverse problems.
I have defended my PhD thesis on image restoration with deep generative models, under the supervision of Nicolas Papadakis and Andr√©s Almansa.
I am currently working on combining deep learning and Bayesian methods for solving problems in cosmology.
