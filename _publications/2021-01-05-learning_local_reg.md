title: "Learning Local Regularization for Variational Image Restoration"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-01-05-learning_local_reg
excerpt: 'In this work, we propose a framework to learn a local regularization model for solving general image restoration problems. This regularizer is defined with a fully convolutional neural network that sees the image through a receptive field corresponding to small image patches. The regularizer is then learned as a critic between unpaired distributions of clean and degraded patches using a Wasserstein generative adversarial networks based energy. This yields a regularization function that can be incorporated in any image restoration problem. The efficiency of the framework is finally shown on denoising and deblurring applications.'
